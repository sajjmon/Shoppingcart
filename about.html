            <h2>This is where it all started</h2>
            <p>From an idea to a project. From a project to a prototype. From a prototype to a product. From our first order to our first warehouse. From our first customer to our 1 millionth customer. From a team of 2 to a team of 60. From Scandinavia to
                everywhere. It’s been a journey. And, we have a feeling it’s only the beginning..</p>
